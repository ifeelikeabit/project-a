    This page was created for seeder.

    Aimed to learn how to create new page/s and how remote all contents.

    You can use add page button for open a new text editor. So you can add any content in there. Is this simply html
    editor.
    By default you can use Tailwind css commands. Just now you can not add another script to local machine. But you can
    use CDN links everywehere.

    Good works dear {{@Auth::user()->name}}
